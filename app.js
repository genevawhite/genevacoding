// This module centers around the theme of 'Indigenous Perspectives on Reducing Harm to Whales in Shipping Practices.' 
// With a focus on Canada's coasts and the First Nations and Inuit groups who govern them, this module aims to 
// highlight Indigenous ways of thinking that are often overlooked. Indigenous perspectives present a strong 
// stewardship of the marine environment that helps us understand the interactions between shipping practices and 
// local marine life. Importantly, Indigenous relational values shift the dominant narrative that humans and human activity
// is separate from other life forms of the land and sea. The case studies presented demonstrate how listening, collaboration,
// and care are valued ways of reducing harm to whales in shipping practices. 
// The map format aligns well with this theme as users navigate certain locations across Canada and their shared significance
// to whales and Indigenous people. At each point, this relationship is highlighted along with a method developed through 
// Indigenous knowledge. 


//Steps made in this assignment: 
//1. Adjusted colour scheme to fit overall app cohesiveness
//2. Implemented the navigation bar for the overall app 
//3. Added Module Theme, Instructions and References 
//4. Reorganized and clarified content in the cards, emphasizing a cultural connection to the Indigenous communities 
//5. Made clickable links

        issueText: "The traditional waters of the Gitga’at First Nation are home to a very dense population of humpback whales. When combined with a rapidly growing rate of ship traffic in BC, it makes ship whale strikes a rising concern. During the summer of 2023, there were three humpback strikes in three days along the pacific coast.",
        responseText: "There has been a tremendous effort from the Gitga’at First Nation to protect the waters through research and conservation initiatives, such as the SWAG project (Ships Whales and Acoustics in Gitga’at Territory). This project focuses on monitoring ship traffic through the use of hydrophones to track ships as well as whales located in a 200km radius. The goal of this project is to suggest different ship traffic practices such as alternative routing and slow down areas to lower the impact of marine shipping on humpback habitat. ",
        cultureText:"The Gitga’at First Nation express a deep and personal relationship with the whales of the area. “The whales are our relatives. A dead whale is like losing a family member, and I know I don’t like seeing pictures of dead whales. We, as Gitga’at, carry a responsibility to protect them, just as they have always sustained us,” said Councillor Cam Hill of the Gitga’at First Nation. This message was shared after the loss of the humpback whale, Midnight, who was struck and killed by vessel traffic. The Gitga’at First Nation remains committed to protecting their marine territory so that future generations of humans and whales alike can thrive in their traditional waters. ",

        issueText:"British Columbia's coastal waters are populated with toothed and baleen whales as well as killer whales, humpback whales and fin whales. The marine vessel traffic through this area is currently growing, and is projected to continue  as industrial projects are implemented; vessel noise will then rise as a consequence. The noise emitted from vessels negatively impacts marine mammals' ability to hunt, communicate and breed, which poses a serious threat to the marine ecosystem and for whales in particular.",
        responseText:"Underwater hydrophone systems provide an efficient method to detect underwater soundscapes, and the impact of vessels on marine mammals as a result. The Malahat Nation sought to understand these human and non-human interactions and invested in developing 20 separate hydrophone stations to examine the underwater noises. With the data they collect, they hope to prevent damage done by vessels in their local waters.",
        cultureText:"The Malahat Nation has long been engaged in marine stewardship due to a close cultural connection particularly with the Southern Resident Killer Whales (“SRKW”). These whales appear as important figures in Malahat stories and are believed to embody the spirits of ancestors. Additionally, the Malahat people have traditionally relied on killer whales for assistance in catching salmon in their fishing nets. This relationship over many years is what has supported the Malahat dedication to marine stewardship and whale protection.",

        responseText:"To address this critical issue, the collaborative efforts of The Conseil de la Première Nation des Innus Essipit and the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke has proposed the Enhanced Maritime Situational Awareness (EMSA) approach. EMSA specifically uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map whale sightings along vessel routes. This data, combined with the knowledge of Indigenous communities who understand the area, helps identify critical habitats and inform decisions on speed restrictions to reduce sound disturbance.",
        cultureText:"The Mohawk Nation’s longstanding concern for the St. Lawrence River marine ecosystem extends to a deep historical and cultural connection. For generations, the river has been a site of hunting, fishing, and trading practices. The Mohawk Nation acts with a strong reciprocal relationship, believing that if they take care of the marine ecosystem, that it will take care of them. This practice is a factor of why the Mohawks were established keepers of the Eastern Door for the St. Lawrence River. This role has influenced their efforts in protecting the whale populations and other life within the river’s ecosystem.",

For instance, cultural practices such as food sharing are important for families and social cohesiveness. Additionally, the beluga meat is a vital source of nutrition for all communities in Nunavut.

The community enjoys an annual beluga harvest which has brought the community together since 1989. However, with whale populations declining in the area, the community must ensure that hunting is sustainable.
